div + p
{
 Here style gets applied to <p> which are directly adjacent of an div tag
}

div ~ p
{
    Here styles get applied to all <p> which come after the div tag inside the parent , this div and p elements need not be adjacent to each other
}

div >p
{
    Here style gets applied to all the p tags which are direct descendant of a div tag what that means is that their immediate parent should be a div tag
}

div p
{
    here style gets applied to all the p tags that come inside a div tag , what that means is that the immediat eparent of the p tag needs not be a div tag
}

here instead of the tags there can be classes also or even attributes

we can set style by using attributes in fthe following manner

ex :- <input type='text' data-set='3' contenteditable> </input>

[data-set='3']
{
styles
}

[contenteditable]
{
    styles
}
