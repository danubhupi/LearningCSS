div + p
{
 Here style gets applied to <p> which are directly adjacent of an div tag
}

div ~ p
{
    Here styles get applied to all <p> which come after the div tag inside the parent , this div and p elements need not be adjacent to each other
}

div >p
{
    Here style gets applied to all the p tags which are direct descendant of a div tag what that means is that their immediate parent should be a div tag
}

div p
{
    here style gets applied to all the p tags that come inside a div tag , what that means is that the immediat eparent of the p tag needs not be a div tag
}

here instead of the tags there can be classes also or even attributes

we can set style by using attributes in fthe following manner

ex :- <input type='text' data-set='3' contenteditable> </input>

[data-set='3']
{
styles
}

[contenteditable]
{
    styles
}





Learned about shorthand and differernt properties

1.When we set the height and width of a div it generally means that we've set the height and 
width of the content inside the div , then when we set the padding , margin , border of the div what we get is that the
total dimensions are width + padding + margin + border width 

2.But usuallyy we don't want this to happen and we want some thing that combines all these and the resultant dimensions are only of width and height
This is done by a property callled

box-sizing:border-box;

the default for this is

box-sizing:content-box;  and this result in point 1 

usually we set this for the entire page like

*
{
box-sizing:border-box;
}
